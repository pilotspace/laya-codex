# Beat 3 · Verify — trust on evidence, then the gate

A change is trusted because its checks pass **and** the residue tests can't catch was examined — not
because the diff reads plausible. Verify is where that trust is recorded, once. Judge it through a
**lens**: the `.add/personas/` entry whose `flow:` names verify (else advisor) and whose `task-kinds:`
covers the node's `kind:`; no fit → `.add/personas-index/use-when.md`; none there → proceed. `add advise <slug> --persona <p>`.

## 1 · Gather the evidence — a fresh, bound receipt

```bash
add run <slug> -- \
    <the test command, carrying its own `--junitxml="${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/add-run.xml"`>
```

`run` executes your command, parses the JUnit report, and writes a **Run receipt** under
`.add/tasks/<slug>.d/runs/`. Your command WRITES the report; `run` READS it, sniffing the path out
of the command you already handed it — either spelling of `--junitxml`, joined by `=` or as the
following token, and the last one named wins.
Name no path at all and the receipt records only an exit code, nothing binds to your rules, and the
gate refuses naming the unbound ones. A runner that reports somewhere its command line never names
states it with `--junitxml` placed BEFORE the `--`, which overrides the sniff. Two properties the gate will
demand:
- **fresh** — the receipt records the git blob hash of every in-`scope:` file at run time; a gate
  recomputes it and refuses on any difference. This kills the stale-green failure (tests that passed
  before the last edit). A directory scope enumerates through git, so **gitignored files (build
  output, dependencies) never enter the digest** — a rebuild cannot stale a receipt no source edit
  touched. Outside git it falls back to mtime and says so.
- **bound** — every check ID in `## CHECKS` must appear in the receipt with `outcome: pass`; a
  `covers:` naming a check that did not demonstrably pass fails the gate. Probed assumptions
  (`· probe:` lines) bind the same way — a declared-checkable reading with no passing check
  holds the PASS.

The gate also demands the build was **entered**: an `act: brief` stamp between the freeze and
this receipt's run (see `phases/build.md`). Briefing after the fact buys nothing — the fix the
refusal names is a re-run under the brief.

**Keep the receipt command narrow.** The gate demands exactly the checks `## CHECKS` binds —
nothing rewards wrapping more. Wrap the **narrowest command that reports every bound check**
(one test file, one marker, one target); the full suite rides CI or a backgrounded run, and a
slow check that no `covers:` names (a whole production build, cost-tuned hashing) stays out of
the receipt loop unless a frozen check demands it. A receipt run costs minutes only when the
wrapped command does — the notary itself is milliseconds. The wrapped command's ceiling is
**900 s by default**; a legitimately slow receipt (a bound build check) raises it explicitly
with `--timeout <s>` — a timeout is *recorded* as exit 124, and the gate will refuse the PASS.

Evidence kinds the engine can actually stamp, strongest first: `test-ids` (a runner reported the
IDs your `covers:` names) > `command-exit` (the command exited 0, and nothing is bound to a named
check). A findings-only explore gates on `sources` instead — cited questions closed, no run
receipt. A weaker kind is a *visible* weakening (the receipt records which it earned), never a
silent one — and a kind nothing can stamp is not a weak rung, it is a false one.

## 2 · Check the residue — three lenses

Automation covers the checks; it does not cover everything. Examine, by hand, the narrow set tests miss:
- **security** — always escalates to a human; a finding is a **HARD-STOP**, whatever the evidence says.
- **concurrency** — races, ordering, atomicity under load.
- **architecture** — boundary and dependency violations a passing test won't reveal.

This residue stays at human speed. You may move as fast as your automated verification carries you, and
no faster on the part only a human can check.

**The refute-read.** Before you record a verdict, read your own green as a skeptic would: take the
receipt as a claim and try to REFUTE it — name the input the bound checks never exercise, the state
the fixture never reaches, the rule a `covers:` binds by id but not by behavior. A green that
survives that read is *earned*; one that has not been read against is only *reported*. Delegating a
beat? `add-advisor` in `refute` mode is an independent reader for exactly this — if it refutes, the
green is not earned, and you fix before recording.

## 3 · The gate — one recorded outcome

```bash
add gate <slug> PASS --by "<name>"          # a PASS auto-closes (add done only after RISK-ACCEPTED)
```

Exactly one outcome, always recorded:
- **PASS** — complete, fresh, bound evidence and clean residue. At **quick** depth, on a green,
  no-residue, `covers`-bound receipt the AI may record the PASS itself at `process` authority — an
  explicit pass you run, never an engine auto-verdict. Residue, or a higher sensitivity floor,
  escalates to a human.
- **RISK-ACCEPTED** — a known, signed acceptance of a non-security risk. Sign it with the reason the
  engine requires: `add gate <slug> RISK-ACCEPTED --by "<name>" --reason "<owner · ticket · expiry>"`.
- **HARD-STOP** — a security finding, or a gate that cannot be honestly passed. The task does **not**
  close: it stays open, and the finding goes back to **Direction** as a change-request (fix the build,
  or add the Must the gate exposed), then you re-Verify. A **security** HARD-STOP always escalates to a
  human and is **never** folded into a RISK-ACCEPTED — and this one is **engine-enforced**: `gate`
  refuses a `RISK-ACCEPTED` on any **security-floored** node (resolve it to PASS, or HARD-STOP), and
  refuses a `PASS` on one carrying no lens. Security-floored = `sensitivity: security`, **or** a
  `scope:` entry matching `index.md`'s `sensitive_paths:` — the path floor arms both refusals, so a
  task editing a sensitive path cannot sign itself away by omitting `sensitivity:`.

No silent skips: a gate that isn't PASS is RISK-ACCEPTED or HARD-STOP, on the record with an owner.
Present the gate via `gate.md`.

## 4 · Observe → learn

Emit any lesson as a tagged delta (`deltas.md`) — it sharpens a 5-DD spec at close. Reuse the checks as
production monitors; what production teaches becomes the next node's Direction (`loop.md`). A milestone
is done when its **goal** is met (exit criteria checked), not merely when its tasks are.
