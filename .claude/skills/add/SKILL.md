  ADD (AI-Driven Development) — a lean, state-tracked workflow where the AI writes the code and
  the human owns direction and verification. Drives every change through one atomic task node:
  Direction (specify · plan · red tests) → Build → Verify, red/green TDD built in, trusted on a
  recorded receipt not a plausible diff. Research rides the same rails: "investigate this bug",
  "evaluate this library", "research X" route to the Explore lane. Use whenever a repo has a
  `.add/` bundle, or the user says "add", "/add", "start a task", "next phase", "specify this",
  "ADD method", "AI-driven development", or wants spec/tests-first discipline over vague-prompt
  coding. Resumes across sessions from the bundle alone — run `add status`, never re-read the repo.

# ADD — direction · evidence · a durable bundle (the agent is the hands)

You turn intent into the right-sized task, then drive it. ADD keeps the AI fast *and* safe by
**fixing direction before the build** (rules, contract, red tests) and **trusting the result on
passing evidence**, not on a diff that reads plausible. The bundle survives; the code is disposable.

**Engine.** `add` below = `python3 .add/tooling/cli.py` (the ABF-1 CLI) — the vendored copy the
installer drops in, which stamps `tooling_engine:`; `status --check` warns if it drifts.
**First run in a fresh project** (no `.add/tooling/` yet): materialize it once with the package
installer — `pilotspace-add init "<name>"` (pip), `add init "<name>"` / `npx @pilotspace/add init
"<name>"` (npm), or `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/cli.js" init "<name>" --no-skill` as the Claude
Code plugin — then drive from `.add/tooling/cli.py`. State lives in the `.add/` bundle — files are
the database, `graph.json` a rebuildable cache. The engine records; it never runs the method or
spawns an agent. The full loop surface — `fold · reopen · drop · deltas · search · show · check ·
milestone-archive` — is wired.

## Always start here (orient — do not skip)

Run **`add status`** first, every session — it is your resume point, read from the bundle, not the
repo. Then branch:

- **No `.add/` yet** → `add init --profile <code|doc> "<name>"` — those two ship, and `init`
  refuses any other name rather than guess. Non-code domain? Take `doc`, then re-author its lenses
  (`domains.md`). Offer to seed starter personas (`seed.md`, opt-in), then size it (Intake).
- **A task is active** (`status` not `done`) → `add show <slug>` — the node whole, its edges — and
  work the beat `add status` names next. The beat is **derived from the node's stamps**, not the
  `status` field — which stays `direction` until close: unfrozen → author + freeze; frozen with no
  green receipt → build; a fresh green receipt → verify (loop below).
- **No active task** → size the request first (Intake), then create scope.

## Intake — size before you create scope (`intake.md`)

Read the request into a task shape, then pick the **lane** (you route; the human vetoes):

- **Quick** — floor first (security · data · architecture, a consumed `gives:`, frozen scope → a Task);
  else ≤3 adjacent files, one-sitting diff, zero unknowns — small new behavior fits. Route and go, no
  node: inline card → red→green → `invariants:` → commit + exactly one `add learn` line. Medium → Task
  `--depth quick`; large → `standard|deep` or a Milestone. Ceremony falls with size; review never does.
- **Task** — one node in the active milestone; `add deltas` then `add show`. The 3-beat loop below.
- **Explore** — the answer IS the deliverable (research · investigate · high unknowns) — explore-first:
  questions + a hard budget freeze, and the gate reads the cited `## FINDINGS` brief directly —
  **no run receipt** for a findings-only explore (`phases/explore.md`). One contract-shaping
  unknown already argues this lane; freezing a contract on a guess ships the wrong thing with
  perfect receipts.
- **Project / milestone** — a theme, or a slice too big for one task. `add deltas` + `add search`, then
  load the persona whose `flow:` includes **advisor** BEFORE drafting (skip silently if none is seeded), draft the
  milestone (goal · scope · exit criteria · breadth-first task list), confirm it, create it and its
  tasks, and record the lens: `add advise <milestone> --persona <p>`.

**The floor is closed:** anything touching **security · data · architecture** always becomes a real
task — never Quick, whatever its size. **Security is always a HARD-STOP.** When in doubt, size up.

## The 3-beat loop (this file IS the loop; refs load on demand)

One task = one atomic node. Three beats, one human decision:

1. **DIRECTION** (`phases/direction.md`) — compose the whole bundle in ONE draft, then take the ONE
   approval. The draft, section by section:
   - `## RULES` — Must · Reject: what you were told. `## EDGES` — `E<n>` boundary cases; a line you
     FILL is gate-bound like a Must, an untouched placeholder owes nothing.
   - `## ASSUMPTIONS` — sweep EVERY `gives:` surface on EVERY dimension (`who · which · when ·
     absent · order · experience`): `A<n> [<dim>] covers: <S ids> · <what the spec does NOT say —
     and the reading you took> -> <cost if wrong>`, or retire a pair with `[<dim>] n/a · <why>`. A
     cheaply-checkable guess is better discharged than priced: run the two-minute probe and record
     `found: <what>` + its evidence on the line.
   - `## PLAN` — contract shape (authored into `gives:`/`needs:` frontmatter) · strategy ·
     `--kind explore`'s required `budget:`. `scope:` is FRONTMATTER (`--scope a,b`), never here.
   - `## CHECKS` — one per Must and per Reject, each with a `covers:` key binding EVERY referent
     you name: Musts, Rejects, probed assumptions, edges. Run them **red for the right reason**.
   - `freeze` REFUSES a template slot, an unauthored `gives:`, an unswept `(dim, surface)` pair, a
     FILLED edge or PROBED assumption no `covers:` names (**R:UNCOVERED** — bind it, never delete it),
     or — at a human floor, and on any Milestone stamped `--authority human` — a decision no human
     answered (**`add interview <slug>`**, R:UNINTERVIEWED). `add todo` counts them down as you author.
   - The ONE approval stamps direction closed: **`add freeze <slug> --by "<name>" --authority
     human`**. Get the composed prompt with `add brief <slug>` — refs resolve from the graph, so a
     spec edit re-scopes it with no edit here.
2. **BUILD** (`phases/build.md`) — code until every red check is green. Change **no** check and **no**
   frozen `gives:`; stay inside `scope:`. A discovered constraint or a strategy turn is *steering* —
   record it, seal untouched: `add replan <slug> --note "<what changed>"`. Anything that would move
   a frozen surface is a change-request back to Direction, never a silent edit.
3. **VERIFY** (`phases/verify.md`) — gather evidence, check the 3 residue lenses (security · concurrency
   · architecture — **security HARD-STOP**), then `add run <slug> -- <test cmd> --junitxml="${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/add-run.xml"`
   for a fresh, bound receipt — `run` reads the report path your command names. Wrap the **narrowest
   command that reports every bound check**; the full suite rides CI (run it anyway before any receipt
   touching the engine). **No runner for your domain? Write one** — `run` parses JUnit XML and does not
   care what produced it (`domains.md`). Then **`add gate <slug> PASS --by "<name>"`** — a **PASS
   auto-closes** the task. `add done` is only for closing after a signed `RISK-ACCEPTED`.

Emit **lessons** as you learn them, tagged by the spec they sharpen (`ddd · sdd · udd · tdd · add`);
the close DRAINS the ones it filed (`loop.md`, `deltas.md`). Present every human decision — intake ·
freeze · gate · close — as a guided choice with the goal→done→plan arc (`gate.md`). A project-fit
persona loads by FIT at every beat — the ROSTER is what is opt-in (`personas.md`) — and never lowers
a gate; delegate to one when a beat wants an expert (`streams.md`): it advises, never freezes or
gates, security stays HARD-STOP. Read-only research fans out; one write serializes the stream.

## Non-negotiable rules (from the method)

<constraints>
1. **Direction before speed.** Never start Build until RULES · PLAN · CHECKS exist and checks are red.
2. **Trust evidence, not inspection.** A change is trusted because its checks pass and the residue
   (security · concurrency · architecture) was examined — not because the code reads fine.
   **A green gate proves the checks you declared ran, passed and are bound — never that they were
   enough.** A check that asserts nothing still binds and still passes. Writing the check that would
   have caught the bug is your job; the engine can only prove you ran the ones you wrote
   (`FORMAT.md` §10).
3. **Never weaken a check or edit a frozen `gives:` to make the build pass.** That inverts the method;
   a real change is a change-request back to Direction.
4. **No silent skips.** Every Verify ends in exactly one recorded outcome — `PASS`, `RISK-ACCEPTED`
   (signed, non-security), or `HARD-STOP`. A security finding is always `HARD-STOP`.
5. **A refusal is the method working.** Every engine refusal names its fix in the same breath
   (`next: <verb>`) — do that fix. Never route around the engine, never hand-edit state files or
   stamps to get past a refusal it just gave you.
</constraints>

```

## Depth dial — steps never change, ceremony does

Depth tunes **ceremony**, not the authority floor. The floor is computed by the engine from
`sensitivity:` (and `index.md`'s `sensitive_paths:`) — `security → human`, `data|architecture → plan`,
else `process` — never from depth.

- **quick** — CARD · CHECKS · EVIDENCE; at a green, `covers`-bound receipt the AI may record the PASS
  itself at `process` authority (an explicit pass you run, not an engine auto-verdict), unless the
  sensitivity floor is higher.
- **standard** — the full node; evidence-gated, at whatever authority the floor computes.
- **deep** — full node + milestone strategy, lowest-confidence-first; a human owns freeze whenever the
  floor (or your judgment) calls for it.

A coined term you cannot decode is in `terms.md` — load it once, not every session.
The method's **why** lives in `FORMAT.md` (the ABF-1 bundle format, in the ADD source repo) —
**referenced, never inlined** (load the State; reference the Story). Read it only when a decision is
genuinely unclear. The AIDD book is deeper background and is **external** (not shipped with the skill)
— treat it as optional; never block waiting to open a file the skill does not ship.
